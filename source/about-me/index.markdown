Hi, my name is Han! I'm a software engineer who used to just focus on becoming a better programmer, until one day I realized I was missing out on other parts of life that are also lots of fun. Now I'm working on expanding my horizons and sharing what I've learned with other programmers in hopes of eliminating the negative stereotype us geeks have and adding value to your life.

Some examples of the stuff I'll be exploring include:
* Marketing (eww... or is it?)
* Performance enhancement

Of course, I'm not going to abandon my software roots either. This blog is created through [Octopress](http://octopress.org), a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) based blogging system using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) flat files, so I'll be sharing what I've learned using it. I'll also go over interesting tech stuff that I find, but the emphasis here will be on non-tech disciplines explained in a more technically rigorous manner.

Lastly, if you like what you see please subscribe through RSS or the email box on the left. Feel free to contact me at han @ this domain, I check email daily and will try to reply to each and every message in a timely manner. Talk soon!

Cheers,
~ Han
